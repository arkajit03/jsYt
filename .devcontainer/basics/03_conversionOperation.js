let score= 33
// we will work on backend so we will get value from frontend now this 33 can be number string anything so 
let score1="44"
console.log(typeof score1);
// to convert thuis string in int
let scoreA=Number(score1);
console.log(typeof scoreA);
//now if we get 44abc and convert it in a number then we will  get data type as number but it will be NaN
let islog=1
let boolean=Boolean(islog)
console.log(boolean);
//we will get output as  true becaue 1 is for true and 0 is for false
// so in summary to conver we will capital the first latter of the datatype of lthe variable like String,Number,Boolean
